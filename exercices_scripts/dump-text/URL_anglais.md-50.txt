   The Tsamba family lost nearly 20 sheep over two cold winter days in
   2011. They live on the edge in Mongolia's Arkhangai Province,
   struggling through harsh winters alongside their herd of sheep. Severe
   winter conditions, known as dzud, have been responsible for the deaths
   of half the family's once 2,000-strong herd over the past three
   winters.

Exiled by the Environment

   In the winter of 2009-10, Mongolia’s characteristically harsh climate
   became too much even for its native animals. About eight million cattle
   died, and the country experienced what could be described as a crash in
   the livestock market. Thousands of herders lost everything.

   Tsamba family lives on the edge, struggling through harsh winters
   alongside their herd. Severe winter conditions, known as dzud, have
   been responsible for the deaths of half the family's once 2,000-strong
   herd of sheep over the past three winters. Recently, in search of
   warmer pastures, the Tsambas moved from Bulgan province in the north to
   this region near a central Mongolian village called Ulziit.

   When photographer Alessandro Grassani read about that devastating
   winter, now known as the White Death, he decided that the story of
   people affected by extreme and unpredictable weather was too common to
   go unexamined. On a trip to Mongolia he documented the “before and
   after”—people struggling to stick it out in rural areas and people who
   had already lost everything and fled to the capital, Ulaanbaatar, where
   almost half of 1.3 million residents live in crowded, informal
   settlements.

   A view of Ulan Bator over the shoulder of an intoxicated man. The
   capital's population has doubled in the past two years, expanding
   outward in a haphazard sprawl, and many inhabitants live in slums known
   as the "Gher district." High levels of unemployment and poverty await
   herders who abandon rural areas and arrive in the city, untrained in
   any skills necessary for urban jobs.

   Sharing the plight of environmental migrants—people who have to flee
   their land because of dramatic and devastating changes in the
   environment—became an obsession for Grassani. He traveled on to
   Bangladesh, Kenya, and Haiti, each a country dealing with a unique
   climate crisis, each with a group of people cast off of their land,
   away from their traditions, and into crowded urban centers.

   Cattle farmers cut grass for their animals on what was once an
   inhabited island called Gazura. It is now submerged by the Meghna River
   in the Ganges Delta, Bangladesh.

   A 26-year-old shepherd from the Turkana tribe was killed in a fight
   against a shepherd from the Marille tribe. Only five days after his
   death, his skull is all that's left of his body, which was eaten by
   wild animals. The insufficient and arid grazing land is the reason
   behind fighting between shepherds of Kenya’s Keniota tribe and
   Ethiopia’s Marille tribe.

   A man bathes on the shore of Haiti's lake Azuei. The growth rate of
   Lake Azuei (and the neighbouring Lake Enquirillo in the Dominican
   Republic) is unprecedented. The size of the lake has almost doubled in
   the last 10 years, destroying and submerging homes and farms. Ghostly
   trunks of dead palm trees are all that remains.

   In Mongolia, it’s extreme cold. In Bangladesh and Haiti, it’s floods
   and rising sea levels, in Kenya desertification and tribal clashes over
   the control of water. These situations cast people out of a newly
   uninhabitable countryside and into poor living conditions in the
   “booming slums” of capital cities, which Grassani calls “ground zero
   for environmental migrants today.”

   Drought caused Sharon's harvest of fruits and vegetables to decrease
   year after year. Eventually she was forced to abandon her village and
   move into an iron hut in Kibera, Nairobi's largest slum, with her two
   children.

   This isn’t an issue that’s going to go away. The International
   Migration Organization says that most studies estimate there will be
   200 million people in this situation by 2050. While environmental
   migrants aren’t recognized by international law like refugees of war,
   Grassani, who has photographed both war and climate change, draws
   parallels between the issues:

   “Man is responsible for both of them. In both cases people suffer
   because they lose their villages, their lands, and their families. It
   doesn’t matter if it is a bomb which destroys and kills your family or
   if it is a hurricane, flood, or drought that force you off your land
   and kill your child because there is no water to drink and nothing to
   eat. The only difference is that we can’t fight against nature—we have
   already lost this war if we don’t react very soon.”

   In search of water for themselves and their animals, nomadic shepherds
   of the Turkana tribe dig in what used to be a riverbed.

   Due to the growing demand for sand used in construction in Port au
   Prince and other Haitian cities, mines are abundant. Land exploitation,
   together with the soil erosion and deforestation endemic in Haiti, make
   the country very vulnerable to the effects of climate change and
   extreme weather events.

   Grassani doesn’t believe the climate migrants he’s met will be able to
   return to their homes. The places he’s working in, he says, “don’t have
   the resources to invest in alternative development policies in the
   areas hit by climate change.”

   But despite dismal projections, he continues exploring these tragedies,
   and, like a visual prophet, sharing them with the world in the hopes
   that people will see and react. After all, he has a daughter who is
   almost two years old. “I often think about what the world will be like
   when she becomes an adult, and of course I worry about it,” he says.
   “This project is my own contribution to our society. This is my
   reaction. This is what I am able to do to awaken consciences.”

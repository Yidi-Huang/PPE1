At last moment, BBC drops documentary on Jewish exile

Filmmaker Ilan Ziv says move stems from incompetence, naivete, political
pressure and ‘lack of courage’

   A last-minute decision by the BBC to drop a documentary that questions
   the extent of the Jewish exile after the Roman destruction of Jerusalem
   in 70 CE was a mixture of “incompetence,” “political naiveté” and “lack
   of courage,” the Israeli filmmaker behind the project has charged.

   The film “Exile: A Myth Unearthed,” which theorizes that many
   modern-day Palestinians could be partially descended from Jews who
   never left the region, was due to be shown in modified form by the BBC
   last week, but was pulled from the schedule at the last moment.
   Director Ilan Ziv has denied that the film aims to delegitimize Israel
   by claiming that the accepted historical narrative of Jewish history is
   false.

   According to publicity material for the film, it “looks at new evidence
   that suggests the majority of the Jewish people may not have been
   exiled following the fall of Jerusalem in 70 AD. Travelling from
   Galilee to Jerusalem and the catacombs of Rome, the film asks us to
   rethink our ideas about an event that has played a critical role in the
   Christian and Jewish traditions.”

   In a lengthy blog post, Ziv wrote that he had been in discussions with
   the BBC since late last year about the project, after the network
   proposed airing an edited version of the documentary. According to Ziv,
   he discovered only recently that the BBC, in conjunction with the
   National Film Board of Canada (which co-sponsored the film), also
   intended to give the film a different title — “Jerusalem: an
   Archaeological Mystery Story” — and possibly remove his name entirely
   from the credits, in order to recast it as an adaptation.

   Ziv said that he had been given a cut of the film only three days
   before the planned air date, but then the BBC officially pulled the
   project, saying that it “doesn’t fit editorially” and that it was
   “under review.”

   He also alleged BBC sources had said a freelance editor hired to re-cut
   the film called it “propaganda.”

   The episode was “a sad story,” Ziv said, noting that he believed BBC
   executives had been fully aware of the film’s potentially controversial
   nature when they acquired it, and hoped to “sneak it in” by changing
   its title. When they were “caught,” he alleged, they panicked and
   dropped the project completely instead of fighting for it.

   “This is ultimately a sad saga of what I believe is a mixture of
   incompetence, political naiveté, conscious or subconscious political
   pressure and ultimately, I believe, a lack of courage of broadcasters
   when they are faced with the complexity of the Middle East issue and
   the intense emotions, fears and aggression it generates,” Ziv wrote.

   He said that he would “show the film publicly throughout the UK and…
   challenge the BBC to either broadcast the film or relinquish its
   rights.”
   Israeli politics told straight

   I joined The Times of Israel after many years covering US and Israeli
   politics for Hebrew news outlets.

   I believe responsible coverage of Israeli politicians means presenting
   a 360 degree view of their words and deeds – not only conveying what
   occurs, but also what that means in the broader context of Israeli
   society and the region.

   That’s hard to do because you can rarely take politicians at face value
   – you must go the extra mile to present full context and try to
   overcome your own biases.

   I’m proud of our work that tells the story of Israeli politics straight
   and comprehensively. I believe Israel is stronger and more democratic
   when professional journalists do that tough job well.

   Your support for our work by joining The Times of Israel Community
   helps ensure we can continue to do so.
